# Trinary-Energy

This is a project to build a working self-perpetuating device that can generate electricity.

It has two parts, the self-perpetuating, and the generator.

Energy scavaging is another part of this project, this will use Crystals, to scavenge vibrations and heat, and turn them into electricity, which will be used to enhance the cooling and control vibrations.

I will be storing [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) files, images, and other formats to show schematics.

## Introduction

Energy from Electrons,
Trinary is the same as Trinity only without the Religion,
it is the 3 Logical State changes seen in Atoms under an Electron Microscope,
you can see a Solid State, Semisolid State,
and an Invisible State. The Father is the Solid State of Matter,
the Son is the Semisolid State of Antimatter, and the Holy Ghost Spirit of Mother Nature is Invisible.

I will work on designing an Electricity Generator that will power a house,
I will work on many concepts,
including an Infinity Machine, Water Battery, and other ways that work.

I am only interested in what works, and what people can build themselves.

We know about concepts like
Free Energy, Zero Point Energy, Coils, Torus, and other Electronic concepts,
yet we use Nuclear Power, no one will ever learn that lesson,
we know the Torah said God is All Light without Darkness,
we know this is found inside all the Atoms, and all Atoms are Trinary,
because they have Trinary State Changes,
and as Nikola Tesla said,
it takes Electricity to make Light, and God is all Light without Darkness,
therefore people are buying and selling Souls by the Kilowatt,
logically people are Light Beings since we are made of Atoms that have God inside them.

I see the video about Infinity Machines that look like this:

![Infinity Machine](https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/Trinary-Energy/blob/main/images/Infinity.png)

I have no idea if it works, there are a lot of scams just to get you to watch their video,
so I will not link to this video, only tell you they give no details,
and do not seem to answer questions about it,
I did look at the book about the Infinity Coil,
and did not find any information about it,
in the form of schematics,
so maybe I missed something,
but what he said in the book was mostly correct,
I did not verify it, so I say mostly,
we have the need for this technology,
but he admits, he did not know it, the person that told him not to share this does,
so maybe there is nothing to this,
but I do not most such devices do not work, so my goal is simple, science.

I have one goal in the project, keep it simple,
I want to design a magnetic wireframe model with magnets,
with enough power to generate enough power to run a DC or AC Light or LED, or other loads,
without the need to add more energy, no fuel, and no magic,
which is what a lot of scammers use, hidden batteries, power lines,
and other ways to cheat,
this must scale up to power a house for the project goals to be met.

I want to build a framework to mold the magnetic wire around,
it needs to be strong enough to hold the wire while the engine rotates,
and balanced for high speeds.

## Parts

Using Science, we make a test model, and document it,
I will use the following:

* [Magnetic Wire](https://www.amazon.com/Remington-Industries-2232MWKIT-25-Magnet-Enameled/dp/B01EIPQQFK)
* [Magnetic Flux Film](https://www.amazon.com/CMS-MAGNETICS-Magnetism-Applicable-Including/dp/B0B5YJ8CWM)
* [Magnetic Polarity Tester](https://www.amazon.com/General-Tools-AMY6-Magnetic-Tester/dp/B0019F90JW)
* DC and AC Electric Generator to test both methods
* Plastic type Board to test machine on
* Plastic to hold the magnetic wire in place making framework
* Magnets
* Toroid
* Capacitors
* Resisters
* Diodes
* Transistors
* Coil
* Crystals

We will have holders for the magnets, coil, and generator,
the magnets need to be removable to test the coil without them.

The main frame of this system called a Trinary Energy Motor,
it is the frame, and can be mounted to the Test Platform,
this is a non-conductive material, that can be 3D printed,
it will also house any Magnets and other internal parts.

## Trinary-Energy-Motor

The Trinary Energy Motor is a system comprised of a frame,
that holds a model that supports the magnetic wire,
I will call this the Trinary Energy Motor Model,
it is non-conductive, and must be balanced,
and support high speeds,
and ideally would be 3D printed for accuracy.

We must first design the Model,
and I do not have any software that will do this,
but I will test out software that might help,
and since I only have access to a Linux,
Arch Linux Manjaro is my main OS,
and I have Windows 10 and 11,
but want to keep this open source,
so I will only use Linux,
and use WINE,
Windows Integration Not Emulation,
to run any Windows application I need,
as such,
only ones that I can get running will be included,
so you will find a Wiki on [Wine](https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/Trinary-Energy/wiki/Wine).

## Generator

The Trinary Energy Motor is what drives the Generator.

The Generator can be off the shelf, AC or DC,
it all comes down to how much horsepower and RPMs it takes.

I would like to design a low RPM, low torque Generator.

## Testing

We need to build this project on a Test Platform 24" by 12" conductive board,
and we need to have a multimeter, and Magnetic Polarity Tester,
other equipment that would make this testing better is:

* Oscilloscope
* Spectrum Analyzer if not in Oscilloscope
* 3D Printer
* Soldering Iron


## Help

This project only uses the issue, there are other unrelated forums like:
Over Unity [https://overunity.com/5144/infinity-coil/](https://overunity.com/5144/infinity-coil/)
